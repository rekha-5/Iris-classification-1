# Iris-classification-1
Iris classification refers to the task of categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their characteristics. This task is a classic example in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition.

The Iris dataset, commonly used for this task, contains measurements of various parts of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each iris specimen in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

To classify iris flowers, machine learning algorithms are trained on a subset of the dataset with known labels. The algorithm learns patterns from the features (sepal and petal measurements) and their corresponding labels. Once trained, the model can predict the species of new iris flowers based on their measurements.

Common machine learning algorithms used for iris classification include:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: This algorithm classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors in feature space.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVM constructs a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that separates different classes of data points.

3. **Decision Trees**: Decision trees recursively split the feature space into regions that are homogenous in terms of the target variable (iris species in this case).

4. **Random Forests**: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

5. **Neural Networks**: Neural networks, especially deep learning architectures, can be used for iris classification, where they learn complex patterns in the data through layers of interconnected neurons.

After training, the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a separate test dataset. The goal is to build a model that accurately classifies iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements.
